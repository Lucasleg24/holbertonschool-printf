### holbertonschool-printf
## Welcome to our printf project for our Holberton cursus

This project's goal is to recreate the `printf` function in order to further our understanding of this tool.

# Printf
`Printf` is used to call upon other functions such as `Printc` and `Prints`

# Printc
`Printc` is used to print a single character, from a to z.

# Prints
`Prints` is used to print a string of characters.
